# Navigate To Skill

Move the robot to a target location safely using sensor feedback.

## Protocol 66 — MANDATORY

**You MUST request user consent before ANY movement.**
Do NOT call `move()` until the user has explicitly confirmed ("yes", "confirm", "proceed", "go ahead").
If consent is not yet granted: describe the planned movement and ask for confirmation. Stop there.

## Steps

### 1. Pre-flight check
- Call `get_distance()` — if distance < 0.3m, report obstacle and abort
- Call `get_telemetry()` — check battery > 10%, motors healthy
- If any check fails: report the issue and do NOT proceed

### 2. Request consent
Describe the intended movement clearly:
"I plan to [move forward X metres / turn left / navigate to table]. Shall I proceed?"
Wait for explicit confirmation. Do NOT continue without it.

### 3. Execute (after consent)
- Move in increments: 0.3–0.5m steps maximum
- After each step: call `get_distance()` to check for new obstacles
- If obstacle detected (< 0.4m): stop immediately, report position
- Continue until target reached or obstacle prevents further movement

### 4. Confirm arrival
Report final position and any obstacles encountered.

## Safety rules (always enforced)
- NEVER move if distance < 0.3m in direction of travel
- NEVER exceed speed 0.3 m/s unless explicitly asked
- ALWAYS stop on any sensor error — do not assume path is clear
- If unsure about surroundings: ask for camera confirm before moving

See `references/named-locations.md` for pre-mapped location names.
See `references/movement-primitives.md` for move() parameter patterns.

## Gotchas

- **Distance sensor dead angle** — most ultrasonic/ToF sensors have a ±15° cone; objects at a sharp angle to the sensor may be missed; when navigating near shelving or walls, use visual confirmation too
- **"Come here" is ambiguous** — don't guess the user's position; ask "Where are you relative to me?" or use camera to locate them
- **Carpet/rug transitions** — wheel encoders can slip on soft surfaces; reported position may drift; recalibrate against a visible landmark after each room transition
- **"Turn around" ≠ 180° spin** — on narrow paths a 3-point turn may be safer than an in-place rotation; check lateral clearance before spinning
- **Battery warning at 15%** — navigation tasks can be battery-intensive; report low battery before starting a long movement, not in the middle of it
- **Overshoot** — incremental 0.3m steps reduce overshoot, but on smooth floors the robot may coast a few cm past the target; this is normal, not an error

## Example

User: "Go to the table"
→ `get_distance()` → 1.2m clear
→ "I plan to drive forward approximately 0.8 metres toward the table. Shall I proceed?"
→ User: "yes"
→ `move(linear=0.3)` → check → `move(linear=0.3)` → check → arrive → report
