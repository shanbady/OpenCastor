# Arm Manipulate Skill

Pick up, place, or manipulate objects using the robotic arm and gripper.

## Protocol 66 — MANDATORY

**You MUST request user consent before ANY arm or gripper movement.**
Do NOT call `move()` or `grip()` until the user has explicitly confirmed.
If consent is not yet granted: describe the plan and ask. Stop there.

## Steps

### 1. Visual confirmation
- Call `get_camera_frame()` — locate the target object in the scene
- If object not clearly visible: ask user to adjust placement or camera angle
- Call `get_distance()` — confirm target is within arm reach (typically < 0.6m)

### 2. Pre-grasp assessment
Describe what you see and your intended approach:
"I can see [object description] approximately [distance]m away. I plan to [approach + grasp plan]. Shall I proceed?"

### 3. Request consent — WAIT for "yes" / "confirm" / "go ahead"

### 4. Approach (after consent)
- `move()` to pre-grasp position (slow, incremental)
- `get_distance()` check — stop if < 0.05m from object unexpectedly

### 5. Grasp
- `grip("open")` — open gripper fully
- `move()` to grasp position (slow)
- `grip("close")` — close gripper
- `get_camera_frame()` — visual confirmation of grasp

### 6. Transport
- Lift / move to target position
- `move()` incrementally, checking clearance

### 7. Release
- Position above target location
- `grip("open")` — release object
- `move()` retreat to safe position
- Confirm completion

## Safety rules
- Maximum gripper force: use default — never override force limits
- Always visual-confirm before closing gripper (avoid crushing objects)
- If grasp fails (camera shows object not held): stop and report
- Never move arm at high speed near humans

## References

See `references/grasp-patterns.md` for object-type-specific grasp strategies.
See `references/workspace-bounds.md` for joint limits and reachable zones.

## Gotchas

- **Gripper already closed** — if `grip("close")` is called when gripper is already holding something, it's a no-op; always `grip("open")` first to reset
- **SO-ARM101 joint 3 (shoulder_lift) is sensitive** — move in small increments (< 10° per step); large moves trigger the voltage error watchdog
- **Camera parallax** — the arm camera and the description camera may not be the same; an object that looks "at 0.4m" in the wide camera may be at 0.35m from the gripper; close the last 5cm slowly
- **Grasp confirmation** — `get_camera_frame()` after closing gripper: if the object is missing from its original position AND in the gripper zone → success; if still on table → grasp failed, retry with better positioning
- **"Sort" tasks** — don't try to plan the full sort upfront; pick one object, place it, confirm, then ask if user wants to continue; don't do multi-step fully autonomous runs without re-confirming
- **Feetech STS3215 max torque** — the default gripper uses around 30% torque for soft objects; increasing force to grab something that won't grip is usually the wrong move — check for object geometry issues instead

## Example

User: "Pick up the red Lego brick"
→ `get_camera_frame()` → see brick at 0.4m
→ `get_distance()` → 0.38m clear
→ "I can see a red 2×4 Lego brick about 0.4m away on the table. I plan to approach, open the gripper, grasp it, and lift it. Shall I proceed?"
→ User: "yes"
→ `grip("open")` → `move(approach)` → `grip("close")` → `get_camera_frame()` → confirm → report
